*The State of Museum Digital Practice (2021)* is written, edited and published by students in *Museums and Technology* at George Washington University. Each student has conducted research into a topic related to the state of museum digital practice today. Students may synthesize current research and practice around a single idea, dive deeper into a technology or case study, or speak more broadly on the theme of digital practice and its impact on the museum. There is room for experimentation in form, content and style.
