The [*Master of Arts in Museum Studies*](https://corcoran.gwu.edu/museum-studies) program at [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) responds to the evolving museum profession by combining hands-on training with future-focused theoretical engagement.  Students gain foundational knowledge about the state of museum work today, practical skills and the ability to critically engage with developments in the field. Our location in the nationâ€™s museum capital offers a unique opportunity to connect to national and global conversations at the cutting edge of museum practice.

Coursework offers both breadth and depth in *Collections Management*, *Museum Management*, *Exhibitions and Visitor Experience*, and *Public Engagement*. Our students come from a range of academic disciplines, from history and anthropology to art history and the natural sciences.
